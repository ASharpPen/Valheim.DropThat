- v3.1.2:
	- Fixed: `drop_that.drop_table.before_changes.cfg` generating empty. Introduced in 3.1.0 when fixing the items file, apparently the problem was just moved.
- v3.1.1:
	- Fixed: Setting QualityLevel didn't always apply correctly, and would instead modify durability.
- v3.1.0:
	- New options:
		- CharacterDrop: `ConditionNotBiomes`
		- CharacterDrop: `ConditionNotEnvironments`
		- CharacterDrop: `ConditionNotKilledByDamageType`
		- CharacterDrop: `ConditionNotKilledByEntityType`
		- CharacterDrop: `ConditionNotKilledBySkillType`
		- CharacterDrop: `ConditionNotKilledWithStatus`
		- CharacterDrop: `ConditionNotKilledWithStatuses`
		- CharacterDrop: `ConditionNotLocation`
		- DropTable: `ConditionNoteBiomes`
		- DropTable: `ConditionNotEnvironments`
		- DropTable: `ConditionNotLocation`
		- DropTable: `ConditionNotWithinCircle`
	- Fixed: `drop_that.drop_table.after_changes.cfg` was in certain situations displaying the finalized drop indexes, instead of the id's used for configuring them.
	- Fixed: `drop_that.character_drop.items.txt` generating empty on first load.
- v3.0.8:
	- Compatibility: v0.219.13.
	- Fixed: Potential exceptions during config load for DropTable and CharacterDrop.
- v3.0.7:
	- Fixed: Potential null-reference exception for DropTable during debug file generation.
	- Fixed: Potential null-reference exception for CharacterDrop during debug file generation.
- v3.0.6:
	- Compatibility: Moved debug printouts to slightly later in world startup. This is to allow time for modded creatures to be added and therefore show in the debug files.
- v3.0.5:
	- Fixed: Parsing warnings when some config list entries were ending with a `,`, like for biomes. These should have been harmless but annoying.
	- Additional null-checks for DropTable lookups. Certain modded prefabs caused Drop That to throw errors when attempting to find matching config template.
- v3.0.4:
	- Fixed: Servers failing to sync CharacterDrop configs when `ConditionNotAfternoon` was used.
- v3.0.3:
	- Fixed: Command `dropthat:reload` threw null-reference errors in some cases for modded entities.
- v3.0.2:
	- Fixed: Some DropTable types (like chests) were dropping their possible drops, instead of the rolled set. Oops.
	- Fixed: DropTable debug files for `loaded` changes and `after changes` were not generated correctly.
- v3.0.1:
	- Fixed: Old DropTable `SetDropChance` not being internally divided by 100.
	- Fixed: Old CharacterDrop `SetChanceToDrop` not being internally divided by 100.
- v3.0.0:
  - Compatibility: Valheim v0.218.15.
	- Almost complete rewrite of the code. Config loading time should be almost unnoticeable now, even for many- or large config files.
	- Improved feedback when loading configs. If config has typos or unrecognized options, the file and line will be written as warnings in the log on load.
	- Added command: `dropthat:reload`, triggers a reload of all configs. This will also reload nearby objects with drop tables (which turns out, is almost everything), to ensure the loaded drops are applied correctly. Requires being an admin if on a server.
	- Simplfied name of options starting with `Set`, such as `SetChanceToDrop` to `ChanceToDrop`. The old naming will still work but will be considered deprecated.
	- New options:
		- CharacterDrop: `Enable`. Finally added a simple toggle for just enabling / disabling a drop.
		- CharacterDrop: `ConditionNotGlobalKeys`
		- DropTable: `Enable`
		- DropTable: `GlobalKeysAll`
		- DropTable: `GlobalKeysNotAny`
		- DropTable: `GlobalKeysNotAll`
		- DropTable: `ConditionWithinCircle`
	- Removed options from `drop_that.cfg`:
		- DropTable: ClearAllExisting
		- DropTable: ClearAllExistingWhenModified
		- DropTable: AlwaysAppend
	- Added new debugging options to `drop_that.cfg`:
		- DropTable: WriteLoadedDropTableDropsToFile
		- DropTable: WriteDropTablesToFileAfterChanges
		- CharacterDrop: WriteLoadedCharacterDropsToFile
		- CharacterDrop: WriteCharacterDropsToFileAfterChanges
- v2.3.13:

- v2.1.5:
	- Fixed bug with DropTable configured loot dropping at (0,0).

	- Splitting config packages based on type, to reduce risk of them growing too big.

	- Fixed issue with modifiers (eg. SetQualityLevel) not being applied in certain scenarios.
